This algorithm is written to design a binary tree project for managing a creatures family tree. The code includes two classes, the Node class and the Main class. The Node class includes attributes like self.child, which stores a creatures name, self.left and self.right, which distinguish left and right children in the tree, and self.parent, which stores the name of the parent creature. The Node class also includes methods that add children, search for noes, and print tree structure. The Main class manages the binary tree with one method, the menu method. The menu method is the interactive interface for the user to first add a root creature, and then get prompted with various options. The user can either, add a child creature, find a specific creature with those creaturesâ€™ ancestors, or print the entire tree. The program is finally executed by initializing the Main class and running the menu method, which launches an interactive menu for managing the creature tree until the user chooses to exit.
